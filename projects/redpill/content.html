    <code>redpill</code> is a JavaScript visualization inspired by the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain">
      Matrix digital rain.
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    What makes this implmentation unique is that it grabs lines of code from
    your latest public GitHub contributions and uses them as the code rain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interactive embedded demo is below (might take a bit to start up since it
    has to download some snippets from GitHub). 
  </p>

  <div id="header" style="font-size: 20px;
    font-weight: bold;
    position: absolute;
    color: white;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
    left: 50%;
    transform: translateX(-50%);
    margin-top: 40px;">
    <div>Enter a GitHub username</div>
    <input id="username" type="text" value="anderspitman" />
    <input id="submit" type="button" value="Restart" ></input>
  </div>
  <div id='root' style="height: 400px;"></div>

  <p>
    It's designed to be easy to add to any web page. Basically just give it
    the id of a div. Details on installation can be found in the code repo
    <a href="https://github.com/anderspitman/redpill">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've found it really fun to watch, especially since you can recognize
    little snippets you wrote recently. For example, while developing this
    project, most of the code shown was from redpill itself, which seemed like
    a fitting sort of recursive property given the source of inspiration.

  <h1>Future Plans</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Allow explicitly providing a file URL, rather than GitHub username. This
      would make it easier for example to give it a file containing DNA
      sequences or the text of your favorite book.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spruce up the graphics to make it match the original movie much more
      closely. Possibly switch to WebGL (currently uses canvas).
    </li>
    <li>
      Syntax highlighting
    </li>
  </ul>

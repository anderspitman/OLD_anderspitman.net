  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    <code>SpaceForce</code> is a simple space shooter game, where you colonize
    planets and try to take over the whole map. It is heavily
    inspired by
    <a href="https://archive.org/details/GWELL35X">Gravity Well 3.x</a>,
    which was a game I randomly had a copy of as a kid in the 90s. I consider
    this a Gravity Well clone. A demo of my current progress can be found
    <a href="/apps/space-force/">here</a>.

  <h1>Goals</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Bring back the super old-school feel of version 3.x (newer versions have
      improved the graphics somewhat)
    </li>
    <li>
      Make the game easily accessible on a variety of platforms (ie runs in a
      browser)
    </li>
    <li>
      Open source. Code is currently
      <a href="https://github.com/anderspitman/vektar">here</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Match the visual style and most of the gameplay mechanics of Gravity Well
    </li>
    <li>
      Add multiplayer support
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm hoping to eventually extract a game engine from this project. It
      would be a simple engine designed for making vector-graphics games.
      Currently it renders everything to SVG and I'm going to avoid adding
      other backends if I can. At the very least, I think I'll come away from
      this with a simple 2D drawing library. I'm planning to call that
      "vektar", which is why the repo is currently named as such.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Not [currently] goals:</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Adding player AI (I am planning on implementing shuttle and defense AI)
    </li>
  </ul>
